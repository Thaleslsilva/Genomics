# Working Genotype Files

Practical content of the discipline Analysis of Genomic Data of the Graduate Program in Genetics and Animal Breeding at FCAV/UNESP in Jaboticabal - SP - Brazil.

# Material available

* ## R Script - ReadGenotypes.R
    * Reads bovine genotype files using the snpStats package
    
* ## R Script - ReadGen_Illumina2PreGS.R
    * Prepare text file with bovine genotypes for reading using illumina2preGS software

* ## R Script - SNPbyChromosome.R
    * Compares the amount of SNPs per chromosome in the 50K, GGP-HD and HD panels, using the corresponding maps (SNP_Map_50Kv2.txt, SNP_Map_GGPHDv2.txt and SNP_Map_HD.txt, respectively)
    
* ## R Script - Compare_Assembly_UMD_ARS.R
    * Calculates the number of HD panel SNPs that have their position changed to another chromosome, by contrasting the position of the UMD3.1 (SNP_Map_HD.txt) and ARS-UCD1.2 (9913_ARS1.2_777962_HD_marker_name_180910.map) references.
    * Note: In the ARS-UCD1.2 map the non-autosomal chromosomes were coded as: X=(30 and 32), Y=31, MT=33.
    
* ## Data Files - FinalReport_Angus1.txt to FinalReport_Angus5.txt
    * Examples of text files with genetic data for a single animal generated by the GenomeStudio software
    
* ## Map file - SNP_Map_GGPHDv2.txt
    * Reference map of SNPs.
